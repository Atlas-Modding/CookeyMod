# CookeyMod
A mod customizing the experience for Combat Snapshots!

# Usage
You can open the mod's options using the CookeyMod button ingame in the options menu or (if you have it installed) using Mod Menu by clicking the "Mods" button, selecting "CookeyMod" and clicking on the gear button on the top right.
You can disable the button in Minecraft's option menu if you have Mod Menu installed.

# Requirements
You will need to setup Fabric Loader for the Combat Snapshot.
**Fabric API is no longer needed unless you install other mods that depend on it. A version for the Combat Snapshots can be found below.**
Furthermore, I recommend installing [Mod Menu (requires Fabric API)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) for universal and compatible access to the mod settings.

## Setup
### Installing Fabric Loader for the Combat Snapshot:
Make sure that you have Java 8 installed on your PC, if not, download it [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot)

Download the newest custom Fabric Installer jar here: https://github.com/rizecookey/fabric-installer/releases

Double-click to run the installer and make sure to check the "Show Snapshots" check box. Select 1.16_combat-6 in the drop-down list (at the bottom together with older Combat Test versions) and click "Install".

**As of the newest launcher update, you now have to enable "Modded" versions in the Installations tab to find the Fabric loader version!**

### Installing the mod
(No longer necessary for CookeyMod) Download the custom Fabric API version here:
https://github.com/rizecookey/fabric/releases

Download the newest release for CookeyMod here: 
https://github.com/rizecookey/CookeyMod/releases

Navigate to your game directory for the profile (if you didn't change it, it's likely your Minecraft directory, see above) and create a "mods" folder inside it. Inside, put the CookeyMod file you downloaded before alongside any other mods (e.g. Fabric API and Mod Menu) you would like to run. Once you did that, just open the Launcher and launch the profile created before!
