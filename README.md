# CookeyMod
A mod customizing the experience for Combat Snapshots!

# Usage
You can open the mod's options using the /cookeymod command ingame or (if you have it installed) using Mod Menu by clicking the "Mods" button, selecting "CookeyMod" and clicking on the gear button on the top right.

# Requirements
You will need to setup Fabric Loader for the Combat Snapshot alongside the custom Fabric API version (see Setup).
Furthermore, I recommend installing [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) for easier access to the mod settings.

## Setup
### Downloading Fabric Loader for the Combat Snapshot:
Download the Fabric Loader Archive here:
https://combatreforged.com/dl/file/fabric-loader/fabric-loader-0.10.8-1.16_combat-6.zip

Extract the .zip file and put the folder inside of it into the versions folder in your Minecraft directory (see ["Where are Minecraft files stored?"](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131551-Where-are-Minecraft-files-stored-)).
Afterwards, create a new profile in the Launcher, select "release fabric-loader-0.10.8-1.16_combat-6", customize the profile to your liking (like changing game directory?), and hit save.

### Installing the mod
Download the custom Fabric API version here:
https://github.com/rizecookey/fabric/releases

Download the newest release for CookeyMod here: 
https://github.com/rizecookey/CookeyMod/releases

Navigate to your game directory for the profile (if you didn't change it, it's likely your Minecraft directory, see above) and create a "mods" folder inside it. Inside, put the Fabric API and CookeyMod you downloaded before alongside any other mods you would like to run. Once you did that, just open the Launcher and launch the profile created before!
